# ⭐ Zuzu Programming Language

**Zuzu** is a kid-friendly, story-driven esolang (esoteric programming language) designed to make learning code magical and accessible. Inspired by [Rajini.cpp](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/rajini.cpp), it introduces key programming concepts in a fun and visual way—ideal for classrooms, clubs, and creative minds.

🌱 *"Grow your logic like a garden. Cast spells of code. Learn joyfully!"*

## ✅ Features


-  Simple syntax (`plant`, `say`, `cast`)
-  Neurodivergent-friendly language structure
-  Use `+` to combine text and variables
-  Supportive for visual and linguistic learners
-  Interpreter in Python for easy execution

## 🧪 Sample Program
```zuzu
plant name = "Zuzu"
say "Welcome, " + name
```
## Output

```
Welcome , Zuzu

```
## ▶️ Run It

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

```bash
python zuzu_ide.py
```
```
python interpreter.py
```
